  These folders hold library files for some of Eagle3D's components.

  These library files were created by:

  I have a few Eagle-6x library files written, and I will be adding and
 updating the files as I get a chance.

  My goal is to make a library file for every component created in Eagle3D.
  For now, this is all I have.

  If you have any library files that you would like to submit, you can send
 them to me personally,  It is my hopes, that every component that is listed
 as NOEAGLEPAC, will have a library file created for it, so that they are
 readily usable, without having to rely on you to create your own files.
