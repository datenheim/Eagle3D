How to build Eagle3D
====================

There are a couple of scripts in the tools directory. Just cd into
that directory and run the create_eagle_3d.sh shell script and you
should end up with three archives (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .zip).

To get the big overview png with all the macros call the render.sh
script in the tools/ directory.

You can also use make. The following make targets are available:

$ make all
    Creates all Eagle3D release archives

$ make lib
    Creates only the lib (.inc files)

$ make render
    Renders all the macros as small images and creates a big image
    with combines all of the macros into on big image. This step will
    need quite some time to finish. Creating the final output image
    needs also a lot of RAM. 2GiB is not enough in default settings
    so expect some swapping if you have less then 4GiB installed.

$make clean
    Removes all the created files. A clean source tree should be left.
